## Description
A lightweight React-based Vite app that lets users click a button to receive a random quote from an Appwrite database. Users can also submit their own quotes to be stored in the database.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: React (via Vite)
- Backend / Database: Appwrite â€” handles storing and retrieving quotes

## Setup Instructions

# To build for production

```

### Architecture Overview
- Frontend (React + Vite): Presents the UI with a button to fetch random quotes and a form to submit new ones.
- Backend (Appwrite): Hosts a database that stores quotes. The frontend interacts with Appwrite using its SDK to:
  * Fetch a random quote when the button is clicked
  * Submit a new quote via the quote form, which is then saved into the database
