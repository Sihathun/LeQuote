## Description
A lightweight React-based Vite app that lets users click a button to receive a random quote from an Appwrite database. Users can also submit their own quotes to be stored in the database.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: React (via Vite)
- Backend / Database: Appwrite â€” handles storing and retrieving quotes

## Setup Instructions
```# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Sihathun/LeQuote.git
cd LeQuote

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev

# To build for production
npm run build
```
for the Appwrite API, you want to make a .env.local file with the following Attributes
- VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=yourProjectId
- VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=yourDatabaseId
- VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID=yourCollectionId

### Architecture Overview
- Frontend (React + Vite): Presents the UI with a button to fetch random quotes and a form to submit new ones.
- Backend (Appwrite): Hosts a database that stores quotes. The frontend interacts with Appwrite using its SDK to:
  * Fetch a random quote when the button is clicked
  * Submit a new quote via the quote form, which is then saved into the database
